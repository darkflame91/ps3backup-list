# ps3backup-list
A python script to recursively look through a directory with PS3 game backups and generate a list of all the backups (and pkg's) available in it.

This script has not been under version control(till now!)

This script was built, tested and meant for Windows. Mac/Linux, perhaps in the future.

Run the script and Enter the root directory of the backups.

This script uses code by 'LanThief' from [http://lukasz.dk/mirror/forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic60c6.html?t=923] with a few modifications. This is mainly to parse the .SFO binary file used to analyse the metadata.
